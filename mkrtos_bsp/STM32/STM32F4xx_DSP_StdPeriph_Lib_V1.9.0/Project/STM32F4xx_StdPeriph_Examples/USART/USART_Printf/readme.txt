@par Example Description 

This example shows how to retarget the C library printf function to the USART. 
This implementation output the printf message on the Hyperterminal using USART.

The USARTx is configured as follows:
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud  
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
    - Receive and transmit enabled

@par Hardware and Software environment
  
  - This example runs on STM32F405xx/407xx, STM32F415xx/417xx, STM32F427xx/437xx and 
    STM32F429xx/439xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324xG-EVAL (STM32F40xx/
    STM32F41xx Devices), STM32437I-EVAL (STM32F427xx/STM32F437xx Devices) and 
    STM324x9I-EVAL RevB (STM32F429xx/STM32F439xx Devices) evaluation boards and 
    can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM324xG-EVAL and STM32437I-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the DB9 connector 
      CN16 (USART3) and PC serial port if you want to display data on the HyperTerminal.
      @note Make sure that jumper JP22 is in position 1-2
      
  - STM324x9I-EVAL RevB Set-up 
    - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the DB9 connector 
      CN8 (USART1) and PC serial port if you want to display data on the HyperTerminal.
      @note Make sure that jumper JP7 is in position 1-2
 
  - Hyperterminal configuration:
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud
    - flow control: None 


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F4xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Select the project workspace related to the used device 
   - If "STM32F40_41xxx" is selected as default project Add the following files in the project source list:
     - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM3240_41_G_EVAL\stm324xg_eval.c
           
   - If "STM32F427_437xx" is selected as default project Add the following files in the project source list:
     - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM324x7I_EVAL\stm324x7i_eval.c
          
   - If "STM32F429_439xx" is selected as default project Add the following files in the project source list:
     - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM324x9I_EVAL\stm324x9i_eval.c
                 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
