The FPU emulation library was copied from the soft-fp/ directory in the
GNU C Library (glibc), as software FPU support was moved from libgcc to
glibc in recent versions. The code is licensed under the GNU LGPL
version 2.1. Original authors: Richard Henderson, Jakub Jelinek and
others.

As of now, only the routines required for powerpcspe (PowerPC e500v2)
software FPU have been copied, and only those that are part of libc.
libm routines have not been copied, because dietlibc as of now does not
support them for other architectures either.
